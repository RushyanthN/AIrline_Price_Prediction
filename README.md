🛩️ Airline Price Prediction

This project aims to predict airline ticket prices using machine learning techniques. It leverages historical flight fare data and applies advanced modeling techniques such as XGBoost with cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to achieve accurate price predictions.

📌 Features

Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation

Model evaluation with diagnostic plots

Web-based interface using Streamlit for easy interaction

🏷️ Model Training & Evaluation

The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical features, and scale numerical variables.

XGBoost is used as the primary model, optimized through hyperparameter tuning.

The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as RMSE, R², and MAE.

Visual diagnostics help in understanding feature importance and model behavior.
